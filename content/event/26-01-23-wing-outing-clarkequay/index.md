WING members were excited to have a spring outing at Clarke Quay on January 23, 2026. For this outing, we scheduled it at the beginning of the semester to help new members better cohere with the group. 

We enjoyed both the beautiful river view and the pizza! We were happy to see the return of our alumni, especially [Hengchang](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/author/hengchang-hu/), [Victor](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/author/chuang-li/), and [Ibrahim Taha Aksu](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/author/ibrahim-taha-aksu/), as well as our collaborator, Yunshan. We especially thank Hengchang (a WING PhD alumnus) for his generous donation of the pizza (and other items on the bill as well)!
