---

The Singapore Symposium on Natural Language Processing (SSNLP) returns on Wednesday, January 21, 2026, at SUTD as a full-day, in-person event. Since 2018, SSNLP has been the annual gathering of Singapore’s NLP community, bringing together students, faculty, and industry researchers to share ongoing work and spark collaboration. Held in conjunction with AAAI 2026, this year’s symposium will feature invited keynotes from leading researchers in the field, a panel discussion, and an immersive poster-focused program showcasing recent work from Singapore-based researchers published in top venues such as ACL, EMNLP, NeurIPS, ICLR, and AAAI this year (this short intro is propagated from [SSNLP 2026 website](https://ssnlp-website.github.io/ssnlp26/)). 

WING members are delighted to attend the seminar, enjoying keynote talks from guest researchers who travel all the way from AoE to Singapore. We also appreciate the panel discussions led by PC Chairs (from *ACL, ICLR, and NeurIPS conference), who share valuable insights on the peer review process, particularly from the students' perspective.

We also engage in the immersive poster program, and our group is excited to present three posters:
- *Discursive Circuits: How Do Language Models Understand Discourse Relations?* by Yisong Miao and Min-Yen Kan (EMNLP 2025)
- *SkyLadder: Better and Faster Pretraining via Context Window Scheduling* by Tongyao Zhu, Qian Liu, Haonan Wang, Shiqi Chen, Xiangming Gu, Tianyu Pang, and Min-Yen Kan (NeurIPS 2025)
- *Drifting Away from Truth: GenAI-Driven News Diversity Challenges LVLM-Based Misinformation Detection* by Fanxiao Li, Jiaying Wu, Tingchao Fu, Yunyun Dong, Bingbing Song and Wei Zhou (AAAI 2026). 

We thank the symposium organizers for the opportunity to present our work, as well as the enthusiastic audience who engaged with us during the poster sessions!
