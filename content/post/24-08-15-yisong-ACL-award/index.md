Congratulations to WING members, Yisong Miao, Min-Yen Kan, and their collaborators for winning the Senior Area Chair Award at the 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2024) for their paper, *"Discursive Socratic Questioning: Evaluating the Faithfulness of Language Models' Understanding of Discourse Relations."*

Our group is thrilled to announce that we have received a Senior Area Chair Award (Discourse and Pragmatics track) at ACL 2024 for our paper, *"Discursive Socratic Questioning: Evaluating the Faithfulness of Language Models' Understanding of Discourse Relations."* This work, led by our group members Yisong Miao and A/P Min-Yen Kan, in collaboration with Hongfu Liu, Dr. Wenqiang Lei, and Dr. Nancy Chen, introduces a novel scoring framework that leverages LLMs in a Socratic style, testing models on targeted questions, counterfactuals, and converse questions.
