## Research Areas

### AI for Science

We are seeking postdocs interested in cross-disciplinary research, particularly in computational social science and humanities ([NUS CSSH](https://cssh.nus.edu.sg/)). Scholars will collaborate with experts specializing in Southeast Asian studies, public policy, materials science, and computer science topics, fostering innovative approaches to scientific discovery through AI.

### LLM Socioethical Alignment

This position involves working with a cross-institutional team spanning NUS and US institutions on cultural and safety alignment of Vision Language Models (VLMs). The project aims to make VLMs more culturally sensitive and personalized for deployment in the multicultural and multilingual environments common throughout Southeast Asia.

### Fact Checking

As part of the [NUS Centre for Trusted Internet and Community](https://ctic.nus.edu.sg/) (CTIC), scholars will conduct research to help both readers and producers of social media better understand and detect misinformation. The focus is on distinguishing nuance and developing improved information literacy practices.

## Postdoctoral Position Qualifications 

Successful applicants should demonstrate:

- Deep and rigorous research training demonstrated by a doctoral degree in computer science or related area from an advising group well-known for natural language processing, machine learning, digital libraries, and information retrieval research
- Strong record of research, often demonstrated by research publications at premier venues, including ACL, SIGIR, ICML, and ICLR
- Two or more reference letters from current supervisors or employers 

Shortlisted **postdoctoral applicants** will participate in a comprehensive evaluation process including a job talk, technical interview, a criticial writing assignment, and a interview with the lab head.

### Position Details

- **Location:** On-site at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore
- **Start Date:** As soon as possible in 2026
- **Contract:** 3-month probationary period, followed by 2-year contract

**Career Development:** Mentoring aligned with individual career goals, including opportunities for:
- Undergraduate, Masters, and PhD student supervision
- Grant writing and proposal development
- Classroom teaching experience
- Research collaboration and publication

## Doctoral Student Qualifications 

- Deep and rigorous research training demonstrated by a doctoral degree in computer science or related area from an advising group well-known for natural language processing, machine learning, digital libraries, and information retrieval research
- Strong record of research, often demonstrated by research publications at international venues

Shortlisted **doctoral student applicants** will need to pass a criticial writing assignment, a software test and an interview with the lab head.  Doctoral applicants must also meet the rigourous admission standards of the School of Computing.  If you haven't yet applied to be part of SoC, we hope that you will consider SoC for your graduate studies, irrespective of whether WING can host your doctoral studies or not.  If you are admitted, you can try to contact us again after you arrive in Singapore.  If you have questions about graduate studies at SoC NUS, your best bet is to ask our very knowledgeable staff at the graduate office (phd-info@comp.nus.edu.sg).  They know the ins and outs of the application process, deadlines and requirements. 

## Application Process

To apply, please send an email to [knmnyn@nus.edu.sg](mailto:knmnyn@nus.edu.sg), including "WING" in the subject line, clearly specifying which topic(s) you are applying for.

For postdoctoral candidates, reference letters should be sent directly to the same email address by your referees under separate cover.

Due to the high volume of applications, only shortlisted candidates will be contacted.  For more information about WING's research activities and recent publications, visit our lab's website.

WING places an emphasis on the diversity of our Ph.D. cohort so that the group can benefit from a wider perspective, so WING generally limits the number of students and staff from well-served demographics (e.g., male Chinese students).
