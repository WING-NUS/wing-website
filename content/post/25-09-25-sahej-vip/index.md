Sahej's LitePruner wins a Venture Intiation Programme award of 10,000 SGD to prototype and build out a prototype for commercialisation and use in production large language models!  

<!--more-->

LitePruner compresses LLM prompts to cut costs and latency. It works across APIs without retraining and preserves accuracy. A prototype targets high-volume enterprise users.  Sahej is supervised by Dr Barid Xi Ai.

For the VIP, Sahej will be mentored by Prof. [Yan Shuicheng](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/yansc/).  

About the [Venture Initiation Programme](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/entrepreneurship/awards/iepsoc/) at the School of Computing: 

> 1) Is your idea unique or something that has been tried before? (Check out the past projects here for reference)  
> 2) Is there a competitive or differentiating edge? How is it different from what already exists and how is it better?  
> 3) Is there a sizable market and a clearly defined initial target user group for your proposed innovation?  
> 4) Have you done sufficient research on the market need and competition?  
> 5) Does the team have the competencies to deliver?  
> 6) Are you able to demonstrate some early prototypes? (This would be an advantage!)
