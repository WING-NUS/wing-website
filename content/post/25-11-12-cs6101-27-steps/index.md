WING ran an experimental section of our CS6101 Exploration of Computer Science Research, as a trial course on Retrieval Augmented Generation.  

<!--more-->

RAG is now a common gateway experience for the general public as well as students to experience Information Retrieval, a core research area of WING.

The [CS6101 course website](https://wing-nus.github.io/cs6101/) has publicly-available lecture slides, video lecture recordings and scribe notes for the class's topics.

These include sections on LLM generation, Retreival, Ranking, RAG Models, Iterative Retrieval and Advanced RAG topics (inclusive of graph, multimodal RAG) and source credibility estimation.
