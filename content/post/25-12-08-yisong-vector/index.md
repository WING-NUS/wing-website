Check out 👀 Yisong Miao's feature as a Vector Institute research intern in the latest 2025 installment of their news cast. Although he wasn't able to travel to the institute in 🇨🇦 for the immersive physical part, WING is proud that he was able to participate in the programme while staying on the other side of the world!

Yisong mentored with Vector's [Vered Shwartz](https://veredshwartz.blogspot.com/) to understand why LLMs assume certain contexts and what helps them adapt to different cultures in what was his "most interdisciplinary project ever."
As a Vector intern, Yisong also got to network with IMPACT mentors.  We wish him continued success in his research work as he continues his work at WING.
