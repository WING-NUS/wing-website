# Postdoctoral Positions Available at WING Lab, NUS (2026)

The [Web, Information Retrieval, and Natural Language Processing](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg) (WING) group at the [School of Computing, National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) is actively seeking postdoctoral scholars to start in 2026 across three cutting-edge research areas: AI for Science, LLM Socioethical Alignment, and Fact Checking.

The project aims to make VLMs more culturally sensitive and personalized for deployment in the multicultural and multilingual environments common throughout Southeast Asia.

### Fact Checking

The focus is on distinguishing nuance and developing improved information literacy practices.
